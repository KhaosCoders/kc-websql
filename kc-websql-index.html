This element is used within `kc-websql-table` elements.
It defines a table index.

Index names have to be `unique within the whole database`!

Simply place the column and order (ASC / DESC) inside the element.

Example:

		<kc-websql-index name="table_index" unique>name ASC</kc-websql-index>
-->

<script>

	Polymer({
		is: 'kc-websql-index',
		properties: {
			/**
			 * Name of the index
			 * Must be unique within the database!
			 */
			name: String,
			
			/**
			 * Defines a unique index
			 * This constraint will throw an error when ever the index would become unique no more.
			 */
			unique: Boolean
		}
	});
